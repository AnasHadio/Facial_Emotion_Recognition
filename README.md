# Facial_Emotion_Recognition

I will use an appearance-based model for this project. Each image in the data set will be considered as a high dimensional vector. I will have several feature spaces regarding each image. The sample image will be compared to the training set. I will either classify this method as linear or nonlinear.

I will evaluate our results by a quantitative metric. I will be focusing on accuracy and efficiency by minimizing our loss function as well as minimizing loading time. I will be separating our data into, analyzing the different types of emotions a person might have, another data sample would be their facial structure. These categories will have different bases and cannot be analyzed in the same context. In doing this I will be able to measure our algorithm using three different metrics, based on the difficulty to predict correctly.
