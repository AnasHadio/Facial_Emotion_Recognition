# Facial_Emotion_Recognition

We will use an appearance-based model for this project. Each image in the data set will be considered as a high dimensional vector. We will have several feature spaces regarding each image. The sample image will be compared to the training set. We will either classify this method as linear or nonlinear.

We will evaluate our results by a quantitative metric. We will be focusing on accuracy and efficiency by minimizing our loss function as well as minimizing loading time. We will be separating our data into, analyzing the different types of emotions a person might have, another data would be, their facial structure. These categories will have different bases and cannot be analyzed in the same context. In doing this we will be able to measure our algorithm using three different metrics, based on the difficulty to predict correctly.
